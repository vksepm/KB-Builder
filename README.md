# <p align="center"><span style="font-size:20px;">Knowledge base generation system based on LLM large language model</span></p>


KB Builder = Knowledge Base Builder is an open source knowledge base generation system based on the LLM large language model. Based on the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) data generation enhancement method, it provides users with RAG-based knowledge enhancement generation and knowledge base rapid construction capabilities, and is committed to becoming the knowledge construction center of the enterprise. It provides platform-based intelligent dialogue service capabilities, document knowledge base management functions, and supports users to upload documents in docx, pdf, txt, and md formats; users click "Parse Document" to call the large model to generate question-answer data, and filter and generate high-quality knowledge base question-answer data.

- **Wide support for file types**ï¼šSupports direct upload of docx, txt, markdown, and pdf format documents, and will support more text format files in the future;
- **Flexible document processing methods**ï¼šProvides multiple document slicing (intelligent segmentation/recursive splitting/custom logo splitting, etc.) and multiple text cleaning and other RAG document preprocessing methods;
- **Large language model neutrality**ï¼šSupports docking with various large language models to generate QA, including local private large models (Llama 3 / Qwen 2, etc.), domestic public large models (Tongyi Qianwen / Zhipu AI, etc.) and foreign public large models (OpenAI / Gemini, etc.);
- **Knowledge generation and management**ï¼šIt provides multiple preset scenario prompt libraries, supports the generation of high-quality QA question-answer pairs, and supports QA-based knowledge base generation functions. More knowledge base management capabilities such as rewriting and enhanced structured processing will be provided in the future.
